The downspouts are vinyl from Home Depot in Canada they have rounded corners of approx 15mm radius and outside dimensions of 78.7mm x 58.7mm. I'm not sure if other plastic downspouts differ from this if you know please post in the comments.

# Post-Printing

The PVC cement seems to work well; however, the can I used has been sitting in my shed for about 4 years and is more like a gel then a liquid. I'm not sure if that changes how it works. I only applied it to the gutter end and one had a bit of a leak where it must not of filled the gap completely. I fixed it by applying more to the outside. I think it would have worked better to apply glue to both sides (glue doesn't jump) using a syringe to fill the groove in the cap.

One of the caps I printed wept a bit though some layers that must not have been bonded properly, coating the lower half of the end cap in PVC cement stopped this.
